    <string name="help_message">Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is an alternative to infix notation,
        i.e. rather than writing the operator in between the operands (2 + 2), you will write the
        operator after the operands (2 2 +).\n
        \nLet\'s calculate\n
        \n(3 + 4) × 2\n
        \nNotice how we have to place parentheses around the first
        part of the expression because, in infix notation, the multiplication operator has a higher
        precedence than the addition operator, and parentheses have a higher precendence still. In
        reverse polish notation, there is no operator precedence. We can simply type\n
        \n3 4 + 2 ×\n
        \nNote how the expression could only have been written this way. If we got rid of the
        parentheses, we would translate the expression to 3 4 2 × + instead.\n
        \nImagine a stack of numbers. Typing 3 and then Enter will put the number 3 on the stack.
        With one number on the stack, we can do operations that only need one operand, like negating
        the number (+/−). If we now type another 3, we can (immediately) use an operator
        that takes two operands, such as +.\n
        \nIn our example, (3 + 4) × 2, the stack will evolve like this:\n
        \n3
        \n3 4
        \n7
        \n7 2
        \n14
        \n\nFor more information, see:
